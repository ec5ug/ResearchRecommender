## HOW TO SET UP
### Cloning the Repository
To build this program, you must first have a GitHub account and create a personal authentication token. To do this, go
to your profile settings, scroll down on the left to select "<> Developer settings", then "Personal access tokens", and
generate a new token. Make sure to copy (and temporarily store) the token, as you will not be able to do this later
(as it gets hidden for protection).
